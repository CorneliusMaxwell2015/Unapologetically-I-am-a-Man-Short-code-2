## 🔐 Step 3a: Set Up YouTube API Credentials and GitHub Secrets

To enable the GitHub Action to upload videos to YouTube, you need to create YouTube API credentials and store them securely in GitHub Secrets:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Enable the YouTube Data API v3 for your project.
4. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID credentials.
5. Generate a refresh token using the OAuth 2.0 Playground or a similar tool.
6. In your GitHub repo, go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
7. Add the following secrets:
   * `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID`
   * `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET`
   * `YOUTUBE_REFRESH_TOKEN`

These secrets will be used by the GitHub Action to authenticate and upload your video.

## 🔗 Step 4: Embed YouTube Link in README

Once your video is uploaded to YouTube, embed it in your README or any markdown file on your page using this snippet:

```markdown
## 📺 Watch the Trailer

[![Watch on YouTube](https://img.shields.io/badge/Watch-Trailer-red?logo=youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID)
```

Replace `YOUR_VIDEO_ID` with the actual video ID from your YouTube URL. For example, if your video URL is `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abc123XYZ`, then `YOUR_VIDEO_ID` is `abc123XYZ`.

This will display a clickable badge linking directly to your YouTube video, making it easy for visitors to watch the trailer right from your GitHub page.

---

If you want to embed the video player directly in markdown (supported in some markdown renderers), you can use this HTML snippet:

```html
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_VIDEO_ID" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

Replace `YOUR_VIDEO_ID` similarly.

---

This embedding approach helps showcase your video prominently and drives engagement from your GitHub audience.

Would you like me to add examples of both badge and embedded player usage to your page?

Replace `YOUR_VIDEO_ID` with the actual ID from YouTube.

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Use GitHub Secrets to store YouTube API credentials securely.
* Add thumbnails and captions via YouTube Studio.
* Fork this repo to offer clients a ready-to-use pipeline.

## ⚙️ Git LFS Configuration for Large Video Files

To ensure your large video files like `Unapologetically_Trailer.mp4` are handled efficiently in Git, add the following line to your `.gitattributes` file in the root of your repository:

```
assets/videos/Unapologetically_Trailer.mp4 filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
```

This configuration tells Git to use Git Large File Storage (LFS) for this file, which optimizes storage and transfer of large binary files.

Make sure you have Git LFS installed and initialized locally:

```bash
# Install Git LFS (if not already installed)
git lfs install

# Track the video file type
# (This step is optional if you use .gitattributes as above)
git lfs track "assets/videos/*.mp4"

# Commit the .gitattributes file
# and push your changes to GitHub
```

Using Git LFS prevents large files from bloating your Git repository and ensures smooth collaboration and CI/CD workflows.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Upload Errors

If you encounter errors when uploading your video, consider the following common issues and solutions:

1. **Git LFS Setup Issues**
   - Ensure Git LFS is installed and initialized locally (`git lfs install`).
   - Verify your `.gitattributes` file includes the correct filter line for your video files (e.g., `assets/videos/Unapologetically_Trailer.mp4 filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text`).
   - Confirm that you added and committed the video file after tracking it with Git LFS.
   - If you see a small text file instead of the video after downloading from GitHub, Git LFS was not used correctly.

2. **YouTube Format or Codec Issues**
   - YouTube requires videos to be encoded with H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec.
   - Re-export your video from Clipchamp ensuring these codecs are selected.

3. **File Size Limits**
   - GitHub limits files to 100 MB without LFS and 2 GB with LFS.
   - YouTube supports large files but check your account's upload limits.

4. **Corrupted or Incomplete Files**
   - Verify the video plays correctly locally before uploading.
   - Re-export if the file is corrupted or incomplete.

5. **Direct Upload Testing**
   - To isolate issues, try uploading the original exported video file directly to YouTube Studio without going through GitHub.

If problems persist, review GitHub Actions logs for errors or check YouTube's upload error messages for more details.

## ⏳ When to Upload and Add Code

You should upload your video file to GitHub first and commit and push those changes. This push triggers the GitHub Action workflow that automatically uploads the video to YouTube.

- Add or update the GitHub Action YAML (`youtube-upload.yml`) and Git LFS configuration (`.gitattributes`) before your first push that includes the video file.
- Add or update your README or markdown files with the YouTube embed code only after the video is successfully uploaded to YouTube and you have the video ID.

If you encounter upload errors or need to fix Git LFS setup, fix those locally and then push again to GitHub to retry the automated upload.
