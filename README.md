Perfect — since your video was created or exported from Clipchamp, here’s how to move it from Clipchamp to GitHub and then to YouTube:

🔄 Workflow: Clipchamp → GitHub → YouTube
1. Export the video from Clipchamp
- Click Export in Clipchamp and choose 1080p MP4 for best quality.
- Save the file locally (e.g., Unapologetically_Trailer.mp4).
- C:\Users\corne\Downloads\Unapologetically_Trailer
2. Upload to GitHub
You can host the video in your repo for distribution or version control:
- Go to your GitHub repo (e.g., VideoEditingAssets)
- Click Add file → Upload files
- Drag and drop your MP4 file
- Commit with a message like Add trailer video from Clipchamp
3. (Optional) Make it publicly accessible
If you want others to view or download the video:
- Enable GitHub Pages in your repo settings
- Place the video in a folder like /assets/videos/
- Access it via:
https://your-username.github.io/repo-name/assets/videos/Unapologetically_Trailer.mp4
4. Upload to YouTube

Since you're architecting a GitHub-powered video editing platform, you could:
- Create a template README with embedded YouTube links and GitHub-hosted previews
- Offer clients a Clipchamp-to-YouTube pipeline with GitHub as the versioned archive
- Use GitHub Actions to auto-tag releases when new videos are added
